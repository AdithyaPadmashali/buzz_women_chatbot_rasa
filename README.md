# buzz_women_chatbot_rasa
We have built a chatbot using RASA, an open-source ML framework used to build conversational AI systems. We have designed our project in a way such that it can be easily modified, maintained, and extended to make it more robust by using an external corpus file to store relevant information pertaining to our use case. We've provided a UI with buttons to make our bot more user-friendly.
